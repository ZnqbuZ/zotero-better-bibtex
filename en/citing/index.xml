      <description>PSA: as of Zotero 5.0.71, access to the CAYW URL will no longer work from the browser for security reasons; curl and other programmatic access such as from editors access will work.
Good news for TeXnicians and those down with Mark (aka Markdown, RST, whatnot): this is the time to go pester the author of your favorite editor for Zotero integration!

      <title>Migrating from Word/Libreoffice</title>
      <link>/zotero-better-bibtex/en/citing/migrating/</link>

      <description>So you have decided that enough is enough, and you want to migrate your existing Word/Libreoffice document to LaTeX/Markdown. Plenty (well&amp;hellip;) tools exist to help with the migration of your document content, pandoc being the most prominent one, but one thing none of them will do is keep your citations intact. This will not do.
If you install this CSL style in Zotero (or modify it further and use that), Zotero will render the in-text citations as [@citekey] when you ask Zotero to render the bibliography.</description>

      <title>AUX Scanner</title>

      <description>You can populate a collection, or tag items in your library, from an existing paper by scanning the aux file generated by bibtex, or a pandoc-markdown file, for referenced used. Scanning can be triggered from the Tools menu (for tagging the cited items) or by right-clicking a collection (for adding them to a collection). The scanner will read your AUX files and will put entries you cited in the associated LaTeX document into the current collection.</description>
