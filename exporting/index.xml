    <title>Exporting items :: Better BibTeX for Zotero</title>
    <link>/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/index.html</link>
    <description>Better BibTex adds a couple of export formats to Zotero’s export dialog and several ways to improve export for plaintext-based authoring. The Better BibTeX configuration pane can be found under the regular Zotero preferences pane, tab ‘Better BibTeX’ where you can tweak the exports, such as&#xA;Omitting fields from exports to slim down your bib files. Configuring how citation keys are generated. And really a ton more. Additionally you can automate exporting (parts of) your library either using auto-export or pull export.</description>

      <title>Automatic export</title>
      <link>/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/auto/index.html</link>

      <description>To export a library, group or collection, right-click on it in the left Zotero pane and choose “Export Library…” or “Export Collection…”. With BBT’s export translators (e.g., “Better BibTeX”), checking the Keep updated option will register the export for automation. After you’ve completed the current export, any changes to the collection or library will trigger an automatic re-export to update the file. You can review/remove exports from the BBT preferences. While I’ve gone to some lengths to make sure performance is OK, don’t go overboard with the number of auto-exports you have going.</description>

      <title>Markdown/Pandoc</title>
      <link>/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/pandoc/index.html</link>

      <guid>/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/pandoc/index.html</guid>
      <description>In addition to LaTeX, BBT plays very well with pandoc:&#xA;you can drag and drop citations from Zotero into your markdown documents. you can cite as you write in your favorite editor with varying levels of comfort, mostly depending on how easy (VSCode, Sublime) or hard (looking at you Scrivener) it is to extend your editor. you can even convert your markdown document into a LibreOffice/Word document with actual live Zotero items as if you had entered them into Zotero all along (see below) Use CSL, not bibtex with pandoc Many tutorials on the use of pandoc to generate documents with citations seem to use bibtex as a bibliography format.</description>

      <description>You can fetch your bibliography on the url http://127.0.0.1:23119/better-bibtex/collection?[collectionID].[format] 1. You can get this URL for a group, library or collection by right-clicking it and selecting Download Better BibTeX export...&#xA;You can add options to the export as URL parameters:&#xA;&amp;exportNotes=[true|false] &amp;useJournalAbbreviation=[true|false] You can fetch your library as part of your build, using something like curl from your Makefile, or with a BibLaTeX remote statement like&#xA;\addbibresource[location=remote]{http://127.0.0.1:23119/better-bibtex/collection?/0/8CV58ZVD.biblatex}format can be:&#xA;biblatex for BibLaTeX bibtex for BibTeX json or csljson for CSL-JSON yaml, yml or cslyaml for CSL-JSON in YAML format jzon for BetterBibTeX JSON debug format the value of translatorID taken from the header of any existing Zotero translator to get an export in that translator format Pull export will only work if you are compiling your document on the same system your Zotero client with BBT runs on.</description>

      <title>Scripting</title>

      <description>You wanted customized… You got customized. If you go into the Export tab of the Better BibTeX preferences, subtab postscript, you will find a text box (empty by default) where you can edit a javascript snippet which will be executed for each entry generated in the Bib(La)TeX exporter. In this code, you have access to the entry just before it will be written out and cached. There is an API to do this, and it’s fairly stable, but usually you can just open a new issue and ask me to write it, and I’ll add it here (it’s how the examples got here).</description>

      <title>Extra fields</title>
      <link>/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/extra-fields/index.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/extra-fields/index.html</guid>
      <description>In some cases the Zotero fields do not offer a place to enter the data you need to get your exported entries just right. For this Zotero has a so-called “cheater syntax” which allows you to add extra “fields” as separate lines in the extra field all items in Zotero have. These fields are supported by the citation processor inside Zotero, and BBT understands them too, and adds one “cheater syntax of its own.</description>

      <description>LaTeX en unicode If you’re lucky and you live in the 21st century or later, you can just use unicode in BibLaTeX and you don’t have to bother about anything that follows except if you’re the curious kind.&#xA;Some of us though are bound to outlets that still demand BibTeX, and there’s geezers like me who just prefer the aesthetic of TeX commands over fancy-schmancy unicode, or you find TeX commands easier to search for in your doc than having to memorize how to enter Ψ.</description>

      <description>You are a hardcore LaTeX user If you’d really just rather hand-code your LaTeX constructs, BBT makes that possible:&#xA;You can add literal LaTeX anywhere in your item by surrounding it with &lt;script&gt;...&lt;/script&gt; (&lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt; will also work for historical reasons) markers. BBT will convert to/from unicode and (un)escape where required but will pass whatever is enclosed in the pre tags unchanged. An entry tagged with #LaTeX (case-sensitive!) will have all fields exported as if they’re wrapped in &lt;script&gt;.</description>

      <description>You can call into BBT using JSON-RPC on the URL http://localhost:23119/better-bibtex/json-rpc . An example could look like:&#xA;curl http://localhost:23119/better-bibtex/json-rpc -X POST -H &#34;Content-Type: application/json&#34; -H &#34;Accept: application/json&#34; --data-binary &#39;{&#34;jsonrpc&#34;: &#34;2.0&#34;, &#34;method&#34;: &#34;collection.scanAUX&#34;, &#34;params&#34;: [&#34;/My Library/thesis/article1&#34;, &#34;/Users/phantom/Downloads/output.aux&#34;] }&#39;The available methods are:&#xA;autoexport.add(collection, translator, path, displayOptions, replace) Add an auto-export for the given collection. The target collection will be created if it does not exist&#xA;collection: The forward-slash separated path to the collection.</description>
